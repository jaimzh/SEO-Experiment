# SEO Experiment (HTML vs React vs Next.js)


This project is a controlled experiment to understand how Google indexes and ranks websites built with different rendering strategies.

I am testing:

- Static HTML
- React SPA (Client-Side Rendering)
- Next.js (Server-Side Rendering / Static Generation)

All versions:
- Deployed on Vercel

Primary success metric:

If it appears in Google, it’s indexed.
